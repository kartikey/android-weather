The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### For a first real assignment: too big, too small, just right? #####
> It was just right for a  weekly assignment . If future assignments get any bigger than this I don't know how I will manage time with completing assignments for other courses too.


##### What model device did you test your application on? What SDK did you target? #####
> I tested the application on Nexus 5 with API 21 using the emulator.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I ended up doing the assignment in parts. It took approximately 5 hours for me to complete. Most of the time was spent in minor problems and going through documentation.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I received some guidance from the professor for the ViewStub part of the assignment.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> No problems were encountered. It was just that I took a good amount of time trying to figure out some functions that required a lot of scanning through documentations and stack overflow.
